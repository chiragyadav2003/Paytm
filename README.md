<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

- Users can create accounts transfer funds to their app wallet and send money to other users. The system ensures transaction integrity through database transactions mirroring the reliability of bank transactions. Successful transfers credit the recipient and debit the sender while any errors result in a rollback to maintain data consistency.

- By combining these technologies and functionalities my project aims to deliver a robust scalable and secure digital payment solution that provides a seamless experience for users.
